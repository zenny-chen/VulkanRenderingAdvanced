# VulkanRenderingAdvanced
Advanced rendering with Vulkan API

<br />

This project demonstrates how to use a vertex shader, a geometry shader and a fragment shader to render some graphics with Vulkan API.

This project is built on Windows 11 with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and Vulkan SDK 1.3. If you want to generate the SPV files, just run glsl_builder.bat.

The official Vulkan SDK for Windows is here: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows
